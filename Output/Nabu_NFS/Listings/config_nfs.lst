              	; levels of .COM file searching, and prevent access to higher drives
              	; or user levels, with either internal or external password control of
              	; these features. Less obvious differences involve code optimization to

              	; keep your paws off these commands. For compatibility with the stock
              	; CCP, intrinsic DIR and TYPE commands are required. And many users in
              	; MY neighborhood find it more convenient to use the intrinsic LIST
              	; command than to have a LIST/PRINT program on every disk. If you want
              	; to call a transient program by an intrinsic, then CHANGE THE INTRINSIC
              	; NAME IN THE TABLE. Even setting the name to blanks is fine to get
              	; rid of it. The point is, don't remove features others may want, just
              	; because you disagree, then throw it back in our laps. For those who
              	; simply MUST be rid of these commands, the following symbols control
              	; generation of the code in a CLEAN ACCEPTABLE fashion that allows
              	; others to have these features:
              	;
              	;    CPRTYP -	Set to TRUE to generate code for intrinsic TYPE command.
              	;
              	;    WSTYPE -	Set to TRUE to generate an extra three lines of code
              	;		to correctly interpret the WordStar (tm) internal
              	;		end of line hyphen for display, which is the ASCII
              	;		NEWLINE code (1FH) and normally non-printing or
              	;		troublemaking -- thanks to PJH for this one. CPRTYP
              	;		must be TRUE, or this symbol will be ignored.
              	;
              	;    CPRLST -	Set to TRUE to generate code for intrinsic LIST command.
              	;		Since almost all of the LIST code is common to the
              	;		TYPE code, CPRTYP must be set TRUE as well, or this
              	;		symbol will be ignored.
              	;
              	;    CPRDIR -	Set to TRUE to generate code for intrinsic DIR command.
              	;		Note that unlike the various directory programs, a
              	;		restricted DIR command here allows displaying the names
              	;		of SYS file ONLY, so many RCPM operators WANT this code.
              	;
              	;  Remember, you only get a total of 2048 (0800H) bytes of space for
              	; ALL of the generated code, or many other areas of your system
              	; generation will be affected. For example, to be fully SECURE, you
              	; would set SECURE to TRUE, and define MAXDRIV and USRMAX, and maybe
              	; use the internal password by setting INPASS to TRUE (external is
              	; MUCH recommended for easier modification). Those options absolutely
              	; generate too much code unless either CPRTYP or CPRDIR or both are
              	; set FALSE. A system with SECURE set to FALSE is right on the edge,
              	; and requires a give and take on options to fit, i.e. you can have
              	; MAXDRIV and USRMAX with DIR and TYPE if you leave out LIST and
              	; querying on ERASE, and so on.

              	; get a two-column directory display instead of four-column (narrow 40-col
              	; screen, remember) was to have their BIOS poke CCP every time it was
              	; loaded, if there was no terminal interface card in I/O slot 3.
              	; Naturally, that will turn into a random poke on any non-standard
              	; CCP, like this one.  The best way to get this CPR up on the Apple is to
              	; load it into CPM56.COM, at location 0E00H in the image.  The BIOS code
              	; that pokes the CPR can also be modified at that time.  The poke is done
              	; by "STA 0C8B2H", found at 24FEH in the CPM56 image.  To keep this
              	; feature, change the 0C8B2H address in that instruction by hand to
              	; the value generated for the symbol TWOPOK in the DIR routine.  If
              	; you have assembled out the DIR code by setting CPRDIR to FALSE, then
              	; disable this feature by changing the "STA" to "LDA", i.e. set the

              	; a two-column display in all cases, set the TWOCOL switch below to a
              	; value of TRUE, and disable the poke.

              	; The following is presented as an option, but is not generally user-customiz-
              	; able.  A basic design choice had to be made in the design of ZCPR concerning
              	; the execution of SUBMIT files.  The original CCP had a problem in this sense
              	; in that it ALWAYS looked for the SUBMIT file from drive A: and the SUBMIT
              	; program itself (SUBMIT.COM) would place the $$$.SUB file on the currently
              	; logged-in drive, so when the user was logged into B: and he issued a SUBMIT
              	; command, the $$$.SUB was placed on B: and did not execute because the CCP
              	; looked for it on A: and never found it.

              	; function as CCP (look for the $$$.SUB file on A:), but the problem with
              	; SUBMIT.COM still exists.  Hence, RGF designed SuperSUB and RLC took his
              	; SuperSUB and designed SUB from it; both programs are set up to allow the
              	; selection at assembly time of creating the $$$.SUB on the logged-in drive
              	; or on drive A:.
              	;
              	;	A final definition of the Indirect Command File ($$$.SUB or SUBMIT
              	; File) is presented as follows:

              	;		 a series of commands exactly as they would be
              	;		 entered from a CP/M Console.  The SUBMIT Command
              	;		 (or SUB Command) reads this files and transforms
              	;		 it for processing by the ZCPR (the $$$.SUB File).
              	;		 ZCPR will then execute the commands indicated
              	;		 EXACTLY as if they were typed at the Console."
              	;
              	;	Hence, to permit this to happen, the $$$.SUB file must always
              	; be present on a specific drive, and A: is the choice for said drive.
